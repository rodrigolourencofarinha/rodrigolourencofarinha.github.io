## Entrepreneurship: Sharp Selling

**Sharp Selling — Co-Founder**  
*Jul 2018 – Sep 2020 · São Paulo, Brazil*

Sharp Selling was a sales training initiative that used micro-learning and gamification to build habits and improve performance. Our approach focused on objection handling, persuasive techniques, and behavior change.

During this time, we:
- Worked with three client companies.
- Trained over 500 sales representatives.
- Helped improve conversion metrics through targeted training.

We closed the business in 2020 after facing challenges in scaling. The experience shaped how I think about product–market fit, experimentation, and execution.
