Check out everything I’m working on my Github page       ProDeck: PowerPoint Toolbar Add-in https://prodeck. pro/   ProDeck is a PowerPoint add-in designed to help users—especially consultants—work more efficiently with slides. It includes a suite of tools to assemble, format, align, and clean decks with fewer clicks. While many commercial tools offer similar or more advanced features, ProDeck was built to make these capabilities accessible to individuals and small firms that may not have the budget for premium software.     The toolbar includes features to accelerate deck formatting and editing, offering a faster workflow without sacrificing control or design quality. It is available for both Windows and Mac.     Why I Created This      While working as a strategy consultant, I saw how much time could be saved with the right PowerPoint tools. Existing options were either too complex, missing key features, or unstable. So I built ProDeck to include only the tools I actually used—simple, reliable, and efficient for everyday slide work.       For the record, I have nothing against vibe coding—but this was built during solo binge-coding sessions over a boring holiday in 2021.

    "body": "I’m a quantitative researcher focused on empirical problems in marketing strategy. My work investigates how firms innovate, price, and compete—especially in contexts shaped by regulation, digitalization, and shifting customer behavior. I aim to produce research that is rigorous, transparent, and applicable, often grounded in real-world business challenges and developed through collaboration with firms, data providers, and policy institutions. Methodologically, I combine applied econometric techniques—such as panel data models, instrumental variables, and time-varying effect models—with AI-based tools for entity matching, text analysis, and classification. Ongoing Projects: Current as of May 6, 2025  Out with the New, In with the Old: The Impact of Incremental Innovations on Market Share With Leandro Guissoni, Jonny Rodrigues, and Thales Teixeira Status: Preparing Submission    Show Abstract     Radical innovation has long dominated academic and industry discussions due to its potential to disrupt markets and establish long-term competitive advantages. However, many dominant firms in R&amp;D-intensive industries increasingly struggle to develop entirely new technologies. In contrast, nondominant firms are turning to incremental innovations as a more feasible and cost-effective strategy. This study explores whether, and under what conditions, incremental innovations can capture market share compared to radical innovations. We use a comprehensive dataset from a major biochemical knowledge-intensive industry, encompassing over 700 brands and 19,000 customers across 72 months of sales, supplemented with government and field data. Our findings indicate that products developed through incremental innovations—particularly those launched by nondominant firms—can effectively capture more market share than those based on radical innovations. We also find that price-adjusted efficacy is positively associated with market share gains for incremental innovations, an effect not observed for radical ones. Additionally, incremental innovations tailored to local markets perform better, especially among informed customers. We conclude with strategic implications for nondominant manufacturers.     Doing Good, Innovating Less? The Role of ESG Performance in Product Innovation With Yakov Bart and Anatoli Colicev Status: Preparing Submission    Show Abstract     As more firms embrace ESG goals, a critical question emerges: does doing good help or hurt innovation? Drawing on the attention-based view of the firm, we argue that ESG performance can demand significant managerial attention, potentially crowding out focus on product innovation. We test this framework using a panel of 457 publicly listed U. S. firms over 15 years (2007–2021), comprising 19,340 firm-quarter observations. We find that ESG performance is negatively associated with product innovation, and that this relationship is moderated by three contextual factors. R&amp;D intensity improves alignment and mitigates the negative association. Firms facing intense competition are more likely to sustain innovation efforts due to differentiation pressures. In contrast, firms with high ROA may become more risk-averse, reinforcing the negative effect. These findings highlight the unintended trade-offs of ESG commitment and offer guidance on aligning purpose with innovation goals.     Practices for Matching Entities and Data Composition With Yakov Bart and Anatoli Colicev Status: Writing in Progress    Show Abstract     This methodological paper presents a practical pipeline for matching company and product records across unstructured datasets. We propose techniques that combine heuristics, vector embeddings, and manual validation to reduce noise while preserving recall in large-scale marketing datasets.     Generating Marketing Metrics from Unstructured Customer Data Status: Idea Development    Show Abstract     This project explores how large language models and vector-based methods can classify customer activities and sentiment from online reviews. The goal is to automate the generation of marketing metrics—such as usage frequency, purchase drivers, and pain points—to support strategic decisions.     The Impact of Generic Entry on Marketing Mix Effectiveness and Price Sensitivity With Thales Teixeira Status: Idea Development    Show Abstract     This study examines how the entry of generic competitors affects the effectiveness of pricing and distribution strategies in the crop protection market. Using a multi-year panel dataset, we estimate changes in elasticity and brand responsiveness to marketing efforts before and after generic entry events.    "

    "body": "2025/05/14 - Why I’m Starting This BlogI’ve been thinking about having a personal blog for a long time. I always told myself I’d start “later”—when life was less hectic or when my ideas felt more solid. But “later” never came. And still, the urge to share thoughts kept coming back. So here we are. This first post is a simple note to myself (and to anyone else reading) about why this blog exists—and maybe just as importantly, why it doesn’t. What This Blog Isn’t: There are many reasons I’m starting this blog, but before getting into them, I think it’s helpful to be clear about what I’m not trying to do here:  I’m not chasing an audience. I’m not trying to grow a following or optimize for clicks and keywords. If that were the goal, I’d probably be better off using Substack.  I’m not picking a single topic. My interests jump around—from strategy to AI, tech, books, and whatever else is on my mind.  I’m not setting a strict schedule. Some months I might write a lot; others, nothing at all—and I’m okay with that. So Why Write?: Here’s what’s pushing me to hit “publish”:    To think out loud. Writing helps me organize and question my own ideas. Sharing them adds a little pressure to make sense.     To improve how I write. You don’t learn to write by waiting for perfect sentences; you learn by writing imperfect ones, publicly squirming, then doing it again.     To keep track of what I care about. This blog is a public memory of things I found interesting or important at the time I wrote them.     To open the door to new conversations. Maybe someone reads a post, relates to it, and decides to get in touch. That alone makes it worth it.  What You Might Find Here: This won’t be a highly curated publication. Think of it more like a notebook I’ve left open on the table. Topics will probably include:  Artificial intelligence — ideas, tools, and things that break.  Business strategy — especially where it connects with marketing, innovation, or behavior.  Technology and tools — scripts, apps, experiments that help me work or think better.  Reading notes — thoughts on books, papers, or articles that stuck with me. What Comes Next: I don’t know how often I’ll write or how polished things will be. But I’ll try to keep it honest. If something here sparks a thought—or a disagreement—feel free to reach out. "
