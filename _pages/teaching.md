I teach topics related to marketing strategy, innovation, and digital transformation. My approach combines practical experience from consulting projects with insights from academic research. The goal is to help participants apply concepts clearly and effectively in their own work.

## Format and Approach

Sessions are structured to be practical and interactive. I use cases, exercises, and examples from real projects to help connect frameworks to decision-making in complex environments. Whether in the classroom or on-site with teams, the emphasis is on clarity, relevance, and application.
