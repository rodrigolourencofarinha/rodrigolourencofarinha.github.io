Here are some of the personal projects Iâ€™m currently building or maintaining. These projects reflect my interest in developing tools with practical applicationsâ€”often to solve problems Iâ€™ve encountered firsthand, either in research or consulting work.

  <strong>ProDeck: PowerPoint Toolbar Add-in</strong><br>
  <a href="https://prodeck.pro/" target="_blank">https://prodeck.pro/</a>

  <p class="abstract-text">
    ProDeck is a PowerPoint add-in designed to help usersâ€”especially consultantsâ€”work more efficiently with slides. It includes a suite of tools to assemble, format, align, and clean decks with fewer clicks. While many commercial tools offer similar or more advanced features, ProDeck was built to make these capabilities accessible to individuals and small firms that may not have the budget for premium software.

  <p class="abstract-text">
    The toolbar includes features to accelerate deck formatting and editing, offering a faster workflow without sacrificing control or design quality. It is available for both Windows and Mac.

    <summary><strong>Why I Created This</strong></summary>
    <p class="abstract-text">
        While working as a strategy consultant, I saw how much time could be saved with the right PowerPoint tools. Existing options were either too complex, missing key features, or unstable. So I built ProDeck to include only the tools I actually usedâ€”simple, reliable, and efficient for everyday slide work.

    For the record, I have nothing against vibe codingâ€”but this was built during solo binge-coding sessions over a boring holiday in 2021. I hope the grind proves useful to you ðŸ˜Œ.
